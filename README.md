# Loan-Decision-Tree-HW-9

This project uses a decision tree classifier to predict if customers are eligible for loan based on their features. It demonstrates preprocessing steps, model training, evaluation using a confusion matrix, and visualizing the decision tree.

## Dataset

Dataset:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/burak3ergun/loan-data-set 

Decision Tree are a non-parametric supervised learning method used for classification and regression. The goal is to create a model that predicts the value of a target variable by learning simple decision rules inferred from the data features.

## Outputs
Running this dataset the Deicsion Trees gave lots of True Positves, it was 80% accurate on predicting elgilbe customers for loans. However the algorithm was approving loans that should not be been approved.
